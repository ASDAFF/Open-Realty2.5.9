# Open-Realty2.5.9
This is essentially Open-Realty2.5.8 that has been made to run in PHP 5.5 without errors.

Since Open-Realty3 is not free anymore I felt the need to maintai Open-Realty2 for the folks who want to build their websites on a shoe-string budget.

|       INSTALLATION      |
+-------------------------+

1. Extract into your web root directory (www, http_docs, public_html, etc) or in a sub-directory in the web root.
2. In your browser navigate to http://yourdomain.com/your-directory/install. The installation process is fairly straight forward
3. Log in to your admin panel by going to http://yourdomain.com/your-directory/admin. Use:
  username: admin
  password: password
4. Configure your new site to your liking.

That's all!!!
